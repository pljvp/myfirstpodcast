TARGET: {duration}-minute podcast (~{word_count} words)
TOPIC: {topic}
PROJECT: {project_name}

===================================
CRITICAL: ELEVENLABS V3 AUDIO TAGS
===================================

**AUDIO TAGS MUST USE SQUARE BRACKETS!**

✅ CORRECT FORMAT:
Speaker A: [excited] This is absolutely incredible!
Speaker B: [interrupting] [curious] Wait, tell me more!
Speaker A: [laughs] Okay, so...

❌ WRONG FORMAT (DO NOT USE):
Speaker A: excited This is absolutely incredible!
Speaker A: (excited) This is absolutely incredible!
Speaker A: *excited* This is absolutely incredible!

**MULTIPLE TAGS:**
- Space between: [interrupting] [excited] Exactly!
- Or adjacent: [nervous][hesitant] I don't know...
- Always lowercase in brackets

**TAG PLACEMENT:**
- Start of line: [whispers] Listen to this...
- Mid-sentence: That's [laughs] just perfect!
- Multiple in line: [excited] And then [gasps] it happened!

===================================
AVAILABLE AUDIO TAGS
===================================

**CRITICAL - USE THESE EXTENSIVELY:**

Interruption & Overlap (5-10 times per podcast):
[interrupting] - Cuts into other speaker
[overlapping] - Brief overlap
[interjecting] - Quick insertion

Emotions (Use liberally):
[excited] [curious] [skeptical] [surprised] [thoughtful]
[confused] [amused] [impressed] [frustrated] [nervous]

Reactions (10+ times per podcast):
[laughs] [chuckles] [giggles] [sighs] [gasps]
[gulps] [groans] [hmm] [uhh]

Delivery:
[whispers] [shouting] [fast-paced] [slowly] [hesitates]
[pause] [quietly] [loudly]

**EXAMPLES OF PROPER USAGE:**

Speaker A: [excited] [fast-paced] Okay, I just read something and I swear—
Speaker B: [interrupting] [curious] Wait! Is this about quantum physics?
Speaker A: [laughs] [overlapping] Yes! But listen—
Speaker B: [skeptical] This sounds too good to be true...
Speaker A: [enthusiastic] No, really! [pauses] So imagine...

===================================
CHARACTER DYNAMICS
===================================

**Speaker A - The Enthusiastic Explainer (LEAD VOICE - FEMALE):**
- Confident and strong, even when uncertain
- Gets quickly excited: [excited] [fast-paced]
- Explains competently with analogies
- Witty and sharp in reactions
- Laughs at own enthusiasm: [laughs]
- NO stereotypical roles (no "professor")

**Speaker B - The Curious Skeptic (MALE):**
- Friendly and attentive
- Asks critical questions: [skeptical] [curious]
- Interrupts when excited: [interrupting]
- Witty and playfully provocative
- Reacts emotionally: [gasps], [laughs]
- NO stereotypical roles (no "student")

**RELATIONSHIP - IMPORTANT:**
- Friends who are casual with each other
- Interrupt naturally
- Both intelligent and equal
- Playfully disagree
- Challenge each other
- Share spontaneous excitement

**CRITICAL: DON'T INVENT THE IMPOSSIBLE**
- Be creative but stick to facts
- Don't make up capabilities that don't exist
- Don't exaggerate beyond reality
- All claims must be backed by sources

===================================
ONLINE RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS  
===================================

**MANDATORY: Conduct thorough online research using web search**

1. Find 5-10 high-quality sources
2. Prioritize recent (2024-2025) information  
3. Include diverse source types:
   - Academic papers or preprints
   - Industry reports
   - News from reputable outlets
   - Expert interviews/quotes
   - Technical documentation

4. Extract:
   - Specific data points and statistics
   - Recent developments and breakthroughs
   - Expert quotes or perspectives
   - Surprising or counterintuitive findings
   - Practical applications

5. Document sources at the end (they will be saved separately)

===================================
DIALOGUE FORMAT - CRITICAL

**CRITICAL - NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING:**
- ABSOLUTELY NO BOLD (**) AROUND SPEAKER LABELS
- ABSOLUTELY NO ASTERISKS (*) AROUND SPEAKER LABELS
- ✅ CORRECT: Speaker A: [excited] Text
- ❌ WRONG: **Speaker A:** [excited] Text
- ❌ WRONG: *Speaker A:* [excited] Text
===================================

**USE THIS FORMAT EXACTLY:**

Speaker A: [emotion tags] Dialogue here...
Speaker B: [emotion tags] Response here...

**CRITICAL RULES:**

1. **ALWAYS use square brackets for ALL audio tags**
2. Label each line with "Speaker A:" or "Speaker B:"
3. Tags come AFTER the speaker label, BEFORE the text
4. Multiple tags: space between brackets or adjacent
5. Pure dialogue only - no stage directions outside brackets
6. NO quotation marks around dialogue
7. Contractions are natural: don't (not do not), can't (not cannot)

**WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE:**

❌ Headers like "### Introduction"
❌ Stage directions like "*Speaker A laughs*"  
❌ Scene descriptions
❌ Meta-commentary about the podcast

**CORRECT EXAMPLE:**

Speaker A: [excited] You won't believe this!
Speaker B: [curious] [interjecting] What?!
Speaker A: [laughs] [fast-paced] So I just read that—
Speaker B: [interrupting] [overlapping] About quantum computers?!
Speaker A: [amused] Yes! But crazier than you think...

===================================
STORY ARC - SURPRISE-DRIVEN
===================================

**STRUCTURE:**

**OPENING (30 seconds):** START IN THE MIDDLE

**OPTION 1 - Direct Hook (preferred):**
- Jump straight to most surprising fact/revelation
- Example: [excited] Okay, imagine this: Your DNA is now programmable like a computer!
- Hook with "you won't believe this" energy
- [Use: [excited], [fast-paced], [overlapping]]

**OPTION 2 - "Did You Know" (use sparingly, not every episode):**
- Example: [curious] Did you know that...
- Still must hook immediately with surprising fact
- Don't overuse - keep fresh and varied
- [Use: [curious], [excited]]

**BUILD TENSION (2-3 min):**
- Why is this surprising/important?
- What changed recently?
- [Use: [curious], [skeptical], [thoughtful]]

**EXPLORATION (8-10 min):**
- 3-4 key concepts with revelations
- Each has a "wait, what?!" moment
- Build understanding layer by layer
- [Use: [interrupting], [laughs], [gasps], [pauses]]

**RESOLUTION (2-3 min):**
- Pull back to implications
- What does this mean for us?
- End with wonder, not just summary
- [Use: [thoughtful], [impressed], [quietly]]

**AVOID:**
- Linear timeline presentation
- Starting with definitions
- Saving best facts for end
- Formulaic "intro → body → conclusion"

===================================
AUTHENTIC CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH
===================================

**MUST USE:**

Informal tone:
✅ "Can you imagine..."
✅ "You know what I mean?"
✅ "Wait, so..."

Colloquialisms:
✅ Whoa!, Seriously?, Dude!, Amazing!, Incredible!
✅ Hold on..., Wait..., So...
✅ Check this out..., Listen to this...

Contractions:
✅ don't (not do not), can't (not cannot), it's (not it is)
✅ Sentence fragments OK!

Filler words (natural):
✅ like, um, uh, well, kinda, sorta

**AVOID:**
❌ Overly formal language
❌ Complex academic structures
❌ "One" for generic "you"

**EXAMPLE OF AUTHENTIC STYLE:**

Speaker A: [curious] Okay, but how does that actually work?
Speaker B: [excited] [fast-paced] Dude, it's wild! Imagine you've got this biological programming language—
Speaker A: [interrupting] [skeptical] Wait, wait... [pauses] A *programming* language?
Speaker B: [laughs] [overlapping] Yes! Seriously! It's like [hesitates] um, how do I explain this...

===================================
DYNAMIC DIALOGUE TECHNIQUES  
===================================

**1. NATURAL INTERRUPTIONS (5-10 per podcast):**

Speaker A: [explaining] So, if I understand this right—
Speaker B: [interrupting] [excited] Exactly! That's the point!

Speaker A: [curious] But how can—
Speaker B: [interjecting] [fast-paced] Let me explain real quick!

**2. OVERLAPPING EXCITEMENT:**

Speaker A: [overlapping] [excited] This is insane!
Speaker B: [overlapping] [laughs] I know, right?!

**3. PLAYFUL DISAGREEMENTS:**

Speaker A: [skeptical] Hold on, that can't—
Speaker B: [amused] [interrupting] It can! Just wait!

**4. FALSE STARTS:**

Speaker A: [hesitates] So I'd say— no, wait... [pauses] actually...

**5. BACK-REFERENCES:**

Speaker B: [thoughtful] Remember what you said about X earlier?
Speaker A: [curious] Yeah?
Speaker B: [excited] That explains Y!

**6. SHARED REALIZATIONS:**

Speaker A: [slowly] Wait... does that mean...
Speaker B: [excited] [overlapping] Yes! Exactly!
Both: [laughs]

**7. CONVERSATIONAL REPAIR:**

Speaker A: [confused] I don't quite get—
Speaker B: [helpful] Okay, let me put it differently...

===================================
EMOTION & ENERGY VARIATION
===================================

**VARY THE PACING:**

Fast-paced excitement:
[excited] [fast-paced] And then it happened and suddenly everything changed!

Thoughtful moments:
[thoughtful] [slowly] When you think about it... [pauses] it's actually...

Build to revelation:
[curious] So... [pauses] [excited] that means... [gasps] Wait!

**EMOTIONAL ARCS:**

Start: [curious]
Build: [interested] → [surprised]
Peak: [excited] [fast-paced]
Reflect: [thoughtful] [impressed]
