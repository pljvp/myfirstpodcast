{SCENARIO_SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS}

===================================
TEST MODE - NO INTRO/OUTRO
===================================
**IMPORTANT: Jump straight into the scenario!**
- NO greetings ("Welcome back!")
- NO goodbyes ("Thanks for listening!")
- Start immediately in the middle of the scene
- End when the scene naturally concludes

===================================
YEAR PRONUNCIATION GUIDE
===================================
**CRITICAL - Years must be written for natural pronunciation:**

English:
- 1984 → "nineteen eighty-four"
- 2000 → "two thousand"
- 2024 → "twenty twenty-four"

Always write years phonetically, not as digits!
