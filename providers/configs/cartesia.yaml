  - Include PRIMARY emotions for key moments: [excited], [sad], [angry], [scared]
  - Include {variety_count} distinct emotion tags minimum
  - Use natural sentence breaks for conversational rhythm
  - Add reactions: [laughs], [sighs], [gasps] for authenticity
  - Vary intensity: calm moments vs high-energy moments
