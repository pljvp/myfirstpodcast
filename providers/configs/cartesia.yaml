# Main emotion/audio tag instructions
# NOTE: Dialogue is LEADING. Emotions are SUPPORTIVE - they enhance delivery, not drive content.
emotion_tags: |
  Cartesia uses 5 base emotions with intensity. Use ONE tag per line.
  Choose tags that SUPPORT the dialogue's natural emotion.

  **POSITIVITY (happy, excited, content):**
  [excited] [happy] [enthusiastic] [cheerful] [content] [friendly]
  [warm] [grateful] [playful] [amused] [laughs] [proud]

  **CURIOSITY (interested, thinking):**
  [curious] [interested] [thoughtful] [intrigued] [fascinated] [skeptical]

  **SURPRISE (shocked, amazed):**
  [surprised] [amazed] [shocked] [gasps] [impressed] [confused]

  **SADNESS (worried, disappointed):**
  [sad] [disappointed] [worried] [concerned] [nervous] [anxious]
  [sighs] [resigned] [nostalgic] [hesitant]

  **ANGER (frustrated, intense):**
  [angry] [frustrated] [annoyed] [defensive] [determined] [urgent]
  [panicked] [scared]

  **NEUTRAL (no emotion):**
  [neutral] [serious] [calm]

  RULES:
  - ONE emotion tag per line (no compounds like [laughs nervously])
  - Place tag at START of line: Speaker A: [excited] Text here
  - NOT every line needs a tag - use when emotion shifts

  AVOID (ElevenLabs only):
  [interrupting] [overlapping] [whispers] [slowly] [fast-paced] [pause]

# Example dialogue snippets
examples: |
  Speaker A: [excited] I just discovered something incredible!
  Speaker B: [curious] Wait, what did you find?
  Speaker A: [enthusiastic] So you know how everyone thought...
  Speaker B: [skeptical] That sounds too good to be true.
  Speaker A: [laughs] I know, right? But here's the thing...
  Speaker B: [amazed] No way, that actually works?
  Speaker A: [proud] Exactly. And the implications are huge.

# Checklist items for script quality (duration-aware)
checklist: |
  - Dialogue drives the conversation, emotions support it
  - Use ONE emotion tag per line (never compound tags)
  - Include {variety_count}+ distinct emotion tags
  - Mix intensities: calm moments AND high-energy moments
  - Use [laughs], [sighs], [gasps] sparingly for authenticity
  - Not every line needs an emotion tag

# Variety count formula: base + (duration_minutes / 3)
variety_base: 8
variety_per_3min: 1
