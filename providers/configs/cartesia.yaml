# Checklist items for script quality (duration-aware)
checklist: |
  - Use all emotion categories throughout the script
  - Include {variety_count} distinct emotion tags minimum
  - Create {exchange_count} quick back-and-forth exchanges
  - Vary between high-energy and reflective moments
  - Use natural sentence breaks for conversational rhythm
  - Avoid: [interrupting], [overlapping], [whispers], [pause], [fast-paced], [slowly]

# Variety count formula: base + (duration_minutes / 3)
# 10 min = 13-15, 20 min = 16-18, 30 min = 20+
variety_base: 10
variety_per_3min: 1

# Quick exchanges formula: base + (duration_minutes / 5)
exchange_base: 3
exchange_per_5min: 1
