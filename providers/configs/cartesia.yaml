# Main emotion/audio tag instructions
# NOTE: Dialogue is LEADING. Emotions are SUPPORTIVE - they enhance delivery, not drive content.
emotion_tags: |
  Cartesia uses SSML emotion tags. Use ONE tag per line to set emotional tone.
  Choose tags that SUPPORT the dialogue's natural emotion.

  **PRIMARY (best quality):**
  [excited] [angry] [content] [sad] [scared] [neutral]

  **POSITIVE/ENERGY:**
  [happy] [enthusiastic] [cheerful] [friendly] [warm] [playful]
  [grateful] [affectionate] [calm] [peaceful] [amused]

  **CURIOSITY/THINKING:**
  [curious] [interested] [confused] [thoughtful] [contemplative]

  **SURPRISE/AMAZEMENT:**
  [surprised] [amazed] [impressed] [alarmed] [gasps]

  **CONCERN/WORRY:**
  [worried] [concerned] [nervous] [anxious] [stressed]
  [disappointed] [hurt] [guilty] [resigned] [nostalgic]

  **INTENSITY/FRUSTRATION:**
  [frustrated] [skeptical] [sarcastic] [defensive] [determined]
  [emphatic] [urgent]

  **REACTIONS:**
  [laughs] [chuckles] [sighs] [panicked] [hesitant]

  **PROFESSIONAL:**
  [confident] [serious] [proud]

  RULES:
  - ONE emotion tag per line (no compounds like [laughs nervously])
  - Place tag at START of line: Speaker A: [excited] Text here
  - NOT every line needs a tag - use when emotion shifts

  AVOID (ElevenLabs only):
  [interrupting] [overlapping] [whispers] [slowly] [fast-paced] [pause]

# Example dialogue snippets
examples: |
  Speaker A: [excited] I just discovered something incredible!
  Speaker B: [curious] Wait, what did you find?
  Speaker A: [enthusiastic] So you know how everyone thought...
  Speaker B: [skeptical] That sounds too good to be true.
  Speaker A: [laughs] I know, right? But here's the thing...
  Speaker B: [amazed] No way, that actually works?
  Speaker A: [confident] Exactly. And the implications are huge.

# Checklist items for script quality (duration-aware)
checklist: |
  - Dialogue drives the conversation, emotions support it
  - Use ONE emotion tag per line (never compound tags)
  - Include {variety_count}+ distinct emotion tags
  - Mix intensities: calm moments AND high-energy moments
  - Use [laughs], [sighs], [gasps] sparingly for authenticity
  - Not every line needs an emotion tag

# Variety count formula: base + (duration_minutes / 3)
variety_base: 8
variety_per_3min: 1
