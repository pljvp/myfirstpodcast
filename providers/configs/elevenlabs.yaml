# Main emotion/audio tag instructions
emotion_tags: |
  **TURN-TAKING (use throughout for natural flow):**
  [interrupting] - Speaker cuts into other's speech mid-sentence
  [overlapping] - Brief simultaneous speech, natural crosstalk
  [interjecting] - Quick insertion without full interruption

  **EMOTIONS (use liberally on most lines):**
  [excited] [enthusiastic] [happy] [cheerful] [energetic]
  [curious] [questioning] [interested] [thoughtful] [analytical]
  [surprised] [shocked] [amazed] [impressed]
  [worried] [concerned] [nervous] [anxious]
  [skeptical] [frustrated] [annoyed]
  [confused] [hesitant] [uncertain]
  [amused] [playful] [warm] [friendly]

  **REACTIONS (use 10+ times per podcast):**
  [laughs] [chuckles] [giggles] [sighs] [gasps]
  [gulps] [groans] [hmm] [uhh]

  **DELIVERY (vary throughout):**
  [whispers] [quietly] [loudly] [shouting]
  [fast-paced] [slowly] [pause] [hesitates]

  **COMBINE TAGS for nuanced delivery:**

# Example dialogue snippets
examples: |
  Speaker A: [excited] [fast-paced] Okay, I just read something incredible—
  Speaker B: [interrupting] [curious] Wait! Is this about quantum physics?
  Speaker A: [laughs] [overlapping] Yes! But listen—
  Speaker B: [skeptical] This sounds too good to be true...
  Speaker A: [enthusiastic] No, really! [pause] So imagine...
  Speaker B: [gasps] [surprised] Wait, that actually works?!
  Speaker A: [chuckles] [amused] I know, right?

# Checklist items for script quality (duration-aware)
# {interruption_count} will be replaced based on duration
checklist: |
  - Use all emotion categories throughout the script
  - Include {interruption_count} [interrupting] or [overlapping] moments
  - Minimum 15 different tag types per 100 lines
  - Vary between high-energy and reflective moments
  - Use [laughs], [sighs], [gasps] for authentic reactions

# Interruption count formula: base + (duration_minutes / 5)
# 10 min = 5-7, 20 min = 7-9, 30 min = 9-11
interruption_base: 5
interruption_per_5min: 1
